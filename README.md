# Computational semantics seminar

## Overview

Welcome to the website for the Spring 2017 Seminar in Semantics!

This semester, we're taking a look at how natural language semanticists can
exploit tools developed by computer scientists to structure semantic theory,
and possibly develop more principled semantic architectures, with improved
empirical coverage in various domains.

We'll see how *monads* (along with the related concepts of *functors* and
*applicatives*), *continuations*, and *type theory* can be used to ground and
enrich theories of indefinites (and indefiniteness), binding, quantification
and scope, dynamics, focus, presupposition, supplementation, and (one hopes!)
their interactions.

The coursework involves weekly readings, short weekly-ish problem sets (to
help you consolidate understanding of new technical concepts), and a short term
paper (10-15 pages), due at the conclusion of the class. I'll be in touch with
enrolled students after Spring Break about paper topics.

## Course materials

Course materials (including readings, slides, and exercises) can be downloaded
by following the links below. You'll need a password to access some of the
readings, which I'll supply to you via email.
